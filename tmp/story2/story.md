### The attackers retaliated by calling upon their own mage to summon a fierce storm, causing lightning to strike the wall of fire and break it apart. The archers were then overwhelmed by a flock of giant birds that swooped in and blocked their arrows. Lastly, the attackers unleashed a horde of undead warriors that marched towards the defenders.

### The defenders summoned a giant golem to protect them from the undead warriors and the mage created a powerful shield of light to protect them from the lightning. The archers then released a volley of arrows that were infused with magical energy, causing the undead warriors to retreat.
